Visualizations for personal finance.

My banks and credit cards have visualizations on their websites.
But they don't always tell me what I want to know!

For instance, they don't always categorize expenses they way that I would.

The goal is to write code that does useful things with the TSVs I download from my bank.
I'm just going to throw scripts into this repository for now.
